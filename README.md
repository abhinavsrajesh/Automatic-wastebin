# Automatic-wastebin

## Introduction
The NodeMCU Automatic Wastebin is an Internet of Things (IoT) project aimed at revolutionizing waste management processes. By integrating NodeMCU microcontrollers with proximity and waste level sensors, this project automates wastebin lid operation and provides real-time monitoring of waste levels. Through the Blynk IoT platform, users can remotely monitor the status of the wastebin, receive alerts, and control the system. With its hands-free operation and remote accessibility, the NodeMCU Automatic Wastebin enhances efficiency, promotes hygiene, and facilitates sustainable waste management practices.

## Abstract
The NodeMCU Automatic Wastebin project automates wastebin operations and provides real-time monitoring of waste levels. Leveraging NodeMCU microcontrollers and sensor technologies, the system detects obstructions in front of the wastebin and measures the fill level inside the bin. Using the Blynk IoT platform, users can remotely monitor wastebin status, receive notifications, and control the system. The project enhances efficiency, promotes hygiene, and contributes to sustainable waste management practices.

## Advantages
- **Automation:** Lid operation is automated based on sensor inputs, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Users can monitor waste levels in real-time and take timely action to prevent overflow.
- **Remote Accessibility:** The system can be monitored and controlled remotely via the Blynk IoT platform, enhancing convenience.
- **Hygiene Promotion:** Hands-free operation minimizes physical contact with the wastebin, promoting hygiene in public spaces.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized waste collection schedules and resource allocation contribute to operational efficiency.

## Disadvantages
- **Dependency on Internet Connectivity:** Remote monitoring and control rely on internet connectivity, which may pose challenges in areas with poor network coverage.
- **Sensor Calibration:** Sensor accuracy may vary and require periodic calibration to ensure reliable operation.
- **Initial Setup Complexity:** Setting up the system and configuring the IoT platform may require technical expertise.
